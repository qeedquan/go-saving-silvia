What makes our game special:
    We tried to write this game in an hour. Unfortunately 
    we slightly missed the mark. After the time was up, 
    there was about another 20 minutes worth of bug fixes. 
    But we had fun and are still coming down from the 
    adrenaline high, so we don't care terribly. 
    
    Also, we were going to post a time-lapse video capture of our screens
    but unfortunately, the video file got corrupted while saving. Alas :(
